Commander Token Board - User Guide
This is a lightweight, interactive dashboard designed to help Magic: The Gathering players manage complex board states, specifically focusing on creature tokens. It runs entirely in your browser and saves your progress automatically.

1. Adding Tokens
There are three ways to add tokens to the battlefield:

Quick Add (Presets): Browse the sidebar list for common token types (Angels, Goblins, Treasures, etc.).

Left-Click: Pre-fills the "Custom Token" form with that creature's stats so you can tweak them before adding.

Right-Click (or Long Press on Mobile): Instantly spawns that token to the board using default stats.

Custom Creation: Open the "Custom Token" accordion menu to manually input Name, Quantity, Color, Power/Toughness, and Haste status.

Cloning: Click the "Clone" button on any existing token on the battlefield to create an exact copy (the copy enters with Summoning Sickness unless it has Haste).

2. Managing the Battlefield
The board uses "Smart Stacking" to keep your screen clean. Identical tokens are grouped into single stacks.

Tapping & Untapping
Tap One: Click any token stack to tap one creature.

If you have a stack of 5 Goblins and click it, 1 will tap (moving to a new stack) and 4 will remain untapped.

If the stack size is 1, it simply toggles between tapped and untapped.

Tap X: Right-click (or Long Press) a stack and select "Tap Specific Amount" to move a precise number of tokens at once.

Summoning Sickness
Tokens created without "Haste" appear with a "ZZZ" badge.

Safety Lock: If you attempt to tap a summoning sick creature, it will shake visually and refuse to tap.

Override: You can force-tap a sick creature by using the Right-Click menu.

Modifying Tokens
+1/+1 & -1/-1: Use the buttons on the card to add counters. This updates the calculated Power/Toughness displayed on the badge.

Removal:

Right-Click > Destroy 1: Removes a single token from the stack (simulating combat death or sacrifice).

Right-Click > Delete Stack: Removes the entire card from the board.

3. Game Phase Controls
Located in the top header:

Untap / Next Turn:

Untaps all permanents.

Removes Summoning Sickness ("ZZZ") from all creatures.

Auto-Merge: cleans up the board by combining identical separate stacks into single piles.

Reset: Wipes the entire board clean.

Hide/Show Menu: Toggles the sidebar on or off. Use "Hide" to maximize the battlefield view for mobile devices or small tables.

4. Image System
The app determines which image to show based on the following priority:

User Upload: If you upload an image via the Custom Token form, that specific image will be used for that session.

Local Match: If no image is uploaded, the app looks for a local file in the same folder matching the token's name (e.g., a token named "Angel" looks for Angel.png).

Fallback: If neither is found, the token displays a colored background and the first letter of its name.

5. Mobile & Desktop Controls
Desktop: Use Right-Click to access the context menus for Quick Create and Token Options.

Mobile/Tablet: Use Long Press (Tap & Hold) to access the same context menus. The app detects scrolling vs. holding to prevent accidental clicks.
